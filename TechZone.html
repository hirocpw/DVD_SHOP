				<h1 class = "title">What CMS does your business need?</h1>
				<p class = "essay">
				CMS stands for Content Management System, this is a technology that support the collection, managing and publishing of information. Basically, a CMS represents as a tool that are developed to help organizations to manage the content of the website, it provides templates that allow users to create, edit and review their web contents without needing much programming knowledge. In another words, a CMS help users to design and control their website directly on them without having to interact with HTML/PHP codes. Hence, CMS is a piece of software that provides a user-friendly interface for users to develop new websites quickly and easily. In this essay, four CMS systems are discussed and compared, which are: WordPress, Jommla! and Drupal.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "essay">WordPress</h3>
				<p class = "essay">
				WordPress is the world’s most popular CMS, it is a free and open-source CMS based on PHP and MySQL. According to WordPress.org, it was used by more than 24% of the top 10 million websites (WordPress, no date). The main advantage of WordPress is that it is easy to use. WordPress does not required users to have HTML or PHP coding knowledge, and it is preinstalled with plugins and templates that allow users to choose easily. Moreover, the plugin system allows users to create plugins to extend WordPress, this system consists thousands of plugins available for use, the majority of those plugins is free. Along with the plugin system, WordPress also provides a theme system that contains thousands of graphics templates, users can choose the templates to change their website’s look, the most templates that WordPress provided are free, but there are more advanced templates that requires a payment to use. Although the WordPress does not require HTML or PHP knowledge for installation, the users need to have these knowledges if they would like to do some modifications such as removing a date field or change the original templates. Furthermore, the WordPress is an open-source organization, the technical support can only be provided by its forum, it is difficult for users to have a face to face technical support.
				<br><br>Over all, WordPress is a great application to create simple website, if a business does not require complex website with lots of functionalities, it would be a good choice for business to begin with.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "essay">Jommla!</h3>
				<p class = "essay">
				Jommla is an open-source CMS as well, it is written in PHP and stores data in MySQL, MS SQL or PostgreSQL database. Just like other CMS, Jommla also includes plugins, themes and other features such as page caching, RSS feeds, printable versions of pages, news flashes, blogs, search, and support for language internationalization (rockettheme, 2015). The advantage of Jommla is that it provides programming tool and tutorials for users, users who have troubles or problems with Jommla can try to reach out these solutions. Moreover, Jommla has navigation management than help users to manage hierarchies, even if there are couple hundred subpages, the navigation management system allows users to manage them easily. Furthermore, the primary strength of Jommla is the usability. Just like WordPress, Jommla is easy to install and use, users who don’t possess knowledge of programming if they want to create a website, however, the codebase is also opened and ready for users to tap into if there are needs to create something unique and original. 
				<br><br>However, there are also disadvantages of Jommla as well. Some of the plugins in Jommla have compatibility problems, users sometimes cannot use these plugins immediately unless they have PHP knowledges and adjust the plugins seriously. In addition, Joomla is considered more complicated than WordPress and other CMS, many users, beginners especially, are confused about the multitude of functionalities in Joomla, in another word, Joomla does not have easy and friendly interface impression for beginners. Overall, Joomla’s complexity is between WordPress and Drupal, if the users are looking something for more than WordPress, but afraid of overwhelming programming, Joomla is a best choice for them to use. “It's a system of choice for multimedia sites and sites with a lot of content - it's when it performs best.” (Joomla! CMS review, 2017)
				</p>
				
				<h3 class = "essay">Drupal</h3>
				<p class = "essay">
				Drupal is a powerful and comprehensive CMS, it is a developer-friendly tool for building advanced website. Although it is open-source, but unlike the other CMS, Drupal requires very specific programming environment. The majority of users in Drupal are programmers who seek more advanced functionality in their websites, therefore, if users have none or little knowledge in PHP/HTML, it would be very difficult for them to handle this application. The advantages of Drupal are clear. Drupal consists quite a number of functionalities such like: advanced menu management, polls management, graphics modification toll and more. With these functions, developers can explore the possibilities of creating websites from basic simple blog to complicated social networking pages. Furthermore, Drupal has advanced user management system that grant different user groups with different levels of permissions for administrating the website, therefore, when many developers are working on a same website project, this user management system can assign them with certain permission that allows the developers to focus on certain part and not jeopardize others’ functionalities. Also, the technical support of Drupal is sufficient, because most of the users have expertise and experience in developing website, the discussion board provided by Drupal is a good channel for developers to discovers solutions for their troubles. 
				<br><br>The main disadvantage of Drupal is very clear, the complexity of Drupal intimidates those users who don’t know if they have enough knowledge to use Drupal. Also, the installation and modification of Drupal are not very user-friendly, users are required to do some coding when installing. In conclusion, Drupal is not suitable for beginner to use, if the business does not require a complex website and resources, it is not a choice for them. However, Drupal is a good application tool for those developers and business who have higher demands in website.
				</p>
				<p class = "essay">
				In conclusion, in order to find the most suitable CMS, it is essential for those business to understand their demands and goals. If the business requires a simple website with introductions of business, the WordPress is recommended, because WordPress contains many free templets and plugins for organizations that don’t have much budget and want a simple website. Moreover, if the business desires a bit more complex website such as multimedia sites with many contents, the Jommla! will be suitable. Jommla can handle quite advanced website for organizations, and it also does not require much of technical knowledge, the complexity median, between WordPress and Drupal. Finally, Drupal is considered very complicated CMS, it has the potential to complete large website project such as social network, but requires a lot of expertise and experience in website developing field.
				<br><br>In my recommendation, I would recommend the WordPress for a business to develop a website. First of all, WordPress is an open-source CMS and free for individuals and organizations to use. Secondly, WordPress does not require users to have any knowledge or experience to develop a website, it has a good user-friendly interface, people who don’t know how to program can also develop a website as well. More importantly, WordPress contains thousands of templets and plugins, users only need to download the templet and upload their desired content on the website, the WordPress will do the rest of work. Also, if user want a bit more functionality, they can use the plugins features by downloading them and install them. It is the simplest website developing solution on internet. Most business does not have the requirement of building a complex website, therefore, I recommend the WordPress as a CMS choice for business.

				<h1 class = "title">Apache 2 vs. IIS7.5/8.5</h1>
				<h3 class = "essay">Web server</h3>
				<p class = "essay">
				A web server is essential in order to host a website, the name of the web server can apply to a hardware or the software that runs on it, in this essay, the cases of software will be discussed. A web server is an application program that uses Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) to deliver web pages from server side to client side. In current days, there are many web server brand on the market, such as Apache, Internet Information Services (IIS), Sun, Nginx, Google etc. However, the leading web servers in current are Apache and IIS, according to research conducted by Netcraft, in 2015, Apache possesses around 39.25% market share and Microsoft IIS processes 27.83% market share. Discussions about Apache and IIS with serval aspects such as definitions, advantages and disadvantages will be argued in the following paragraphs.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "essay">Apache</h3>
				<p class = "essay">
				Apache is one of the world’s most popular and famous web server software, it was originally built based on NCSA http web server 21 years ago in early 1995 by Apache Software Foundation. Apache is an open source Web server application, it is distributed freely and allows users edit the codes to improve the performance and contribute for the future development (Mockus, Fielding, and Herbsleb, 2002). The running environment for Apache is wide, it is available for Unix, Linux, Windows and OS/2. In 2002, the released of Apache 2.0 provide a new execution environment, it “incorporated a brand-new execution environment that separated the core functionality of the Apache system from the system that actually supported and processed requests” (Brown,2008). Now Apache2 supports many other operating systems including all versions of Windows and Mac OS X. However, Apache is most frequently used with Linux, along with MySQL database and PHP scripting language. The core of the Apache system is called Apache Portable Runtime (APR), it allows Apache core to run with C compiler in many systems. Also Apache has a feature called multi-processing modules to provide supports for processing requests. The Apache is designed to compatible with very wide range of computing languages. It uses dynamic modules by incorporating a language interpreter and improves the execution for languages’ dynamic components such as PHP, Python. (Mockus, Fielding, and Herbsleb, 2002).
				<br>One of the advantages of Apache is that, first of all, the software is free, it means that users don’t need to pay a coin to get the license for running an Apache server, it is also one of the factors of why Apache is popular in the market. Secondly, Apache is open sources which means that programmers around the world can participate in improving the performance of Apache server. And more importantly, as mentioned above, the feature of multi-platform compatibility allows users to run Apache server in a very wide range of operating system in the market basically. 
				But, the disadvantages of Apache are significant, because Apache is open source and supported by a non-commercial group, it cannot provide real tech support. Users who seek supports and helps have no other ways to go but some forums or third party vendors therefore it brings a great deals of inconveniences for users who need an actual tech support for their problems. Furthermore, although Apache is open source, but it is not regularly updated, some bugs may not be fix by immediate fix patch. Also, Apache uses console mode installation, it requires more technical knowledges for users to install and configure, if the users lack of sufficient technical knowledges, it may be hard for them to set up the Apache server.
				</p>
				<h3 class = "essay">IIS</h3>
				<p class = "essay">
				IIS (Internet Information Services) is the web server offered by Microsoft, statistically, it has the second large share of users in the market comparing to Apache. IIS has few versions in the history, for the version of IIS 3.0, It was a just a basic web server, but later IIS 5.0 provide both server and desktop versions. In IIS 6.0, the cooperation between the web server and the operation system became closer, it is a complete rewrite from the previous editions. The IIS 6.0 separates the component of accepting request and the component of processing, which means that it improves the security and performance of the server. Moreover, the separated component of process allows the IIS to maintain TCP/IP connection while a worker process is being recycled or rebooted, this means that the IIS has crash protection and it’s becoming a great advantage of IIS web server (Woo et al., 2011). Furthermore, the IIS provides GUI interface for installation, compare to Apache’s console mode installation, the IIS’s GUI interface brings a significant convenience to the users who don’t possess much technical knowledges in console configuration. Also, since the IIS is Microsoft’s product, the user tech support service is provided completely and conveniently, when problems are surfaced, users can contact Microsoft support team immediately and resolve the problems quickly, thus minimize the potential future losses. 
				On one hand, IIS cooperates well with other Microsoft products, if the users’ working environment is basically all supported by Microsoft, this can be a good feature, but on the other hand, it also limited users’ options. Unlike Apache, IIS can only be used in Windows operation system environment, it is very hard for users to move to other system environment. In addition, although IIS is free for Windows user, but IIS’s source code is proprietary, unlike Apache has millions programmers around the world working together with the source code and try to improve performance of the Apache’s web server, only Microsoft is allowed to examine the IIS’s source codes, and therefore, the fixes for IIS will be regularly but very slowly.

				<h3 class = "essay">Conclusion</h3>
				<p class = "essay">In Conclusion. this essay presents an introduction of the web servers and shows the features of Apache web server and IIS web server. This essay also compares the advantages and disadvantages between the Apache web server and IIS web server, the main advantage of Apache is that Apache is open source and it supports wide range of operation system, the main advantage of IIS is that Microsoft provides complete tech support for their users freely, also IIS has excellent security protection. The disadvantage of Apache is that, Apache only provides community support, users who experience hardship on Apache cannot resolve problems immediately by looking for community support, on the other hand, IIS is embedded with Microsoft Windows operation system, users are stuck in Microsoft if they would like to move to other operation system environment.
				<br><br>
				In my opinion, I would choose IIS web server rather than Apache web server. It is because under my current circumstance, a student who lack of sufficient technical knowledge wants to set up a web server, I need all the help I can get, and Microsoft support team can provide unlimited tech support for me, I don’t need to look into thousands of Apache forums looking for answers. Also, I currently do not possess much knowledges of console configuration, and it’s mandatory for installing Apache, with GUI interface provided by IIS, it’s easier for me to set up a web server. Moreover, same as Apache, IIS is free for use as well, and I am familiar with Microsoft working environment, at current point I don’t think choose IIS over Apache is an illogical move. Therefore, combine my circumstances and the evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages between Apache web server and IIS web server, I consider the option of IIS as my recommendation of web server choice.
